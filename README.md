# modules

A Clojure sample that mirrors [the decorator pattern example by thelowlypeon](https://github.com/thelowlypeon/decorator-design/blob/master/app.php). In addition, it also demonstrates how 'base class' functionality can be modified by instantiating a descendant.  This is not idiomatic Clojure, just an example showing how easy it is to implement complex models in Clojure.

## Usage

This sample is intended to be run from a REPL.

1. Enter the project directory
2. Start a repl
```
lein repl
```
3. Load the main file at the REPL prompt
```
(use 'modules.core :reload) 
```
